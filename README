swh-fetcher-googlecode
======================

This fetcher does:
- parse a gs:// url and transforms it according to the email's rule (see below)
- deriving the file's url as metadata (mediaLink, length, crc32c, md5Hash, etc...)
- writes on disk such metadata file
- deriving the actual content from the mediaLink entry (exactly the url described higher)
- writes on disk such content
- checks the content file's metadata (crc32c, md5, length) match the one described in file metadata
- flag as corrupted the file if it does not

You can get the list of all files stored in Google Cloud Storage, which
power the Google Code Archive here:

https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive/google-code-archive.txt.zip
https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive/google-code-archive-source.txt.zip
https://storage.googleapis.com/google-code-archive/google-code-archive-downloads.txt.zip

Just download and unzip the files. They contain all the Google Cloud
Storage object names in each bucket. From there you will need to just
download the actual files via a basic conversion. For exmaple, with Google
Cloud Storage URL gs://google-code-archive/v2/code.google/hg4j/project.json,
you can get the file's contents by URL-escaping the string and adding it to
googleapis.com. e.g.
https://www.googleapis.com/storage/v1/
b/google-code-archive/o/v2%2Fcode.google.com%2Fhg4j%2Fproject.json?alt=media.
The "?alt=media" part gets the object's contents, not the metadata.

You probably only care about the google-code-archive-source bucket, since
that is where we contain tarballs of git, hg, and the new svn dumps. But if
you were interested in poking around the project metadata (e.g. issues) the
schema is here <http://As for how to make sense of the data, you can see
the Archive's schema here.>.

If you run into any troubles let me know. I'll be able to look into any
missing or corrupt repositories for the next couple months. After that time
we will shut down the Google Code DVCS backends, and only the Google Code
Archive snapshot will remain. (So you resurrecting these projects might
ferret out any problems with my data.)

Cheers,
-Chris

It only what's described only for source archive.
